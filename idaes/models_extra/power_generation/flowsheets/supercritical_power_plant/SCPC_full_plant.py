This is an example supercritical pulverized coal (SCPC) power plant, including
steam cycle and boiler heat exchanger network model.

This simulation model consist of a ~595 MW gross coal fired power plant.
The dimensions and operating conditions used for this simulation do not
represent any specific coal-fired power plant.

This model is for demonstration and tutorial purposes only.
Before looking at the model, it may be useful to look
at the process flow diagram (PFD).

SCPC Power Plant

Inputs:
    Fresh Water (water make up)
    Throttle valve opening,
    BFW - boiler feed water (from Feed water heaters)
    Coal from pulverizers

Main Assumptions:
    Coal flowrate as a function of load, coal HHV is fixed and heat dutty
    splitt from fire side to water wall and platen superheater is fixed.

    Boiler heat exchanger network:
        Water Flow:
            Fresh water -> FWH's -> Economizer -> Water Wall -> Primary SH -> Platen SH -> Finishing Superheate -> HP Turbine -> Reheater -> IP Turbine
        Flue Gas Flow:
            Fire Ball -> Platen SH -> Finishing SH -> Reheater  -> o -> Economizer -> Air Preheater
                                                   -> Primary SH --^
        Steam Flow:
            Boiler -> HP Turbine -> Reheater -> IP Turbine
            HP, IP, and LP steam extractions to Feed Water Heaters


    Models used:
        - Mixers: Attemperator, Flue gas mix
        - Heater: Platen SH, Fire/Water side (simplified model),
                  Feed Water Heaters, Hot Tank, Condenser
        - BoilerHeatExchanger: Economizer, Primary SH, Finishing SH, Reheater
            + Shell and tube heat exchanger
                - tube side: Steam (side 1 holdup)
                - shell side: flue gas (side 2 holdup)
        - Steam Turbines
        - Pumps
    Property packages used:
        - IAPWS: Water/steam side
        - IDEAL GAS: Flue Gas side
