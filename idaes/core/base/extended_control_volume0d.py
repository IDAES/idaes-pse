        This method constructs an isothermal constraint for the control volume.

        Arguments are supported for compatibility with other forms but must be False
        or None otherwise an Exception is raised.

        Args:
            has_heat_of_reaction: whether terms for heat of reaction should
                be included in enthalpy balance
            has_heat_transfer: whether terms for heat transfer should be
                included in enthalpy balances
            has_work_transfer: whether terms for work transfer should be
                included in enthalpy balances
            has_enthalpy_transfer: whether terms for enthalpy transfer due to
                mass transfer should be included in enthalpy balance. This
                should generally be the same as the has_mass_transfer
