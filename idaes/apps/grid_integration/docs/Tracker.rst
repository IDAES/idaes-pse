Tracker
============
Production Cost Models (PCM) computes the time-varying dispatch schedules for each resource using
simplified models. Emerging resources including IESs and industrial demand response
need to determine the optimal operations strategy to track their market dispatch
signal. The ``Tracker`` formulates these decisions as a model predictive control
(MPC) problem.
