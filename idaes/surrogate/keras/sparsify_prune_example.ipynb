    "# Custom Sparsification and Pruning Routines Using IDAES Sparsification and Pruning Utils\n",
    "\n",
    "The IDAES toolkit provides utility functions which allow the user to sparsify and prune Keras sequential neural networks (NNs). Sparsification is the process of setting a desired percentage of weights in each layer to zero. Sparse NNs are desired because they lower the inference time, allowing for faster prediction times. Pruning is the process of removing inactive nodes - nodes which do not contribute to the output - from the network entirely. Similar to sparsification, pruning will lower the inference time of NNs and will also decrease the size of the NN.\n",

Variable $t$ is the current training step, $\\Delta t$ is the timesteps between sparsification steps, and $t_{0}$ represents the number of training steps conducted prior to running sparsification. Finally, $n$ is the number of sparsification steps desired. It should be noted that $t_{0}$, $\\Delta t$, and $n$ are hyperparameters and can be adjusted to maintain accuracy during post-sparsification re-training. Parameters $t_{0}$ and $\\Delta t$ are training parameters set prior to the initial training of a NN and $n$ can be set after the initial training of a NN.\n",

Using these parameters we can train a neural network. By default a Keras epoch with $\\Delta t = N_{x} / N_{batch}$ where $N_{x}$ is the number of data points and $N_{batch}$ is the batch size. This allows the NN to train over all data points in batches of size $N_{batch}$. For this routine we will specify the training steps per epoch by setting the steps_per_epoch argument."
