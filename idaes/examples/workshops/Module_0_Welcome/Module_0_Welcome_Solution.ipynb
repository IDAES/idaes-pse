    "Another effective way to create a list of evenly spaced numbers (e.g., for plotting or other computation) is to use the `linspace` function from the `numpy` package (more information [here](https://www.numpy.org/devdocs/)). Let's import the `numpy` package and use linspace function to create a list of 15 evenly spaced intervals (that is, 16 points) from 0 to 50 and store this in `xlist`. We will also create the `ylist` that corresponds to the square of the values in `xlist`. Note, we must first import the `numpy` package.\n",

A full treatment of the `matplotlib` package is beyond the scope of this tutorial, and further documentation can be found [here](https://matplotlib.org/). For now, we will import the plotting capability and show how to generate a straightforward figure. You can consult the documentation for matplotlib for further details.\n",

    "\n",
    "[Pyomo](www.pyomo.org) is an object-oriented, python-based package for equation-oriented (or *algebraic*) modeling and optimization, and the IDAES framework is built upon the Pyomo package. IDAES extends the Pyomo package and defines a class heirarchy for flowsheet based modeling, including definition of property packages, unit models, and flowsheets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of IDAES does not require extensive knowledge about Pyomo, however, it can be beneficial to have some familiarity with the Pyomo package for certain tasks:\n",
    "* IDAES models are open, and you can interrogating the underlying Pyomo model to view the variables, constraints, and objective functions defined in the model.\n",
    "* You can use Pyomo components to define your objective function or to create additional constraints.\n",
    "* Since IDAES models **are** Pyomo models, any advanced meta-algorithms or analysis tools that can be developed and/or used on a Pyomo model can also be used on an IDAES model.\n",
    "\n",
    "A full tutorial on Pyomo is beyond the scope of this workshop, however in this section we will briefly cover the commands required to specify an objective function or add a constraint to an existing model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next cell, we will create a Pyomo model, and add a couple of variables to that model. When using IDAES, you will define a flowsheet and the addition of variables and model equations will be handled by the IDAES framework.\n",
