    "\n",
    "This example is to demonstrate a supercritical pulverized coal power plant model. The power plant consists of two major sub-systems (or flowsheets), a boiler heat exchanger network and a steam cycle. This jupyter notebook provides the workflow to import the steam cycle flowsheet, import the boiler heat exchanger network, connect and run both the flowsheets, and display the main results.\n"
