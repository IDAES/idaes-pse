# This contains variables for Makefiles.  The defaults should usually work on
# Linux, but this may need editied if you are using other compilers.

# ASL is the location of the ASL build.  By default it is set from the
# ASL_BUILD environment variable, but you can set it direclty here.
# You can get the ASL from here https://ampl.com/netlib/ampl/solvers.tgz, and
# documentation is https://ampl.com/resources/hooking-your-solver-to-ampl/.
# Usually unpacking the ASL files in a convienient location then running:
# > ./configure
# > make
# in that directory would generate a subdirectory called somthing like
# "sys.x86_64.Linux." The exact name would depend on your system. This is the
# directory ASL (or the ASL_BUILD evironment variable should be set to).

ASL=$(ASL_BUILD)

# BOOST is a extra location to look for header files.  Depending on how BOOST is
# obtainted the header files may not be in the default search path. This variable
# is optional, and only needs to be set if the boost header files are not found.
# This should be set to the path that contains the "boost" header file directory
# not the boost header file dircetory.  This can be set here or with the
# BOOST_HEADER environment variable.

BOOST=$(BOOST_HEADER)

# The last part is pretty standard, and specifies the C and C++ compilers as
# well as the file remove and copy commands.
