# IDAES Toolkit

The IDAES Toolkit aims to provide multi-scale, simulation-based, open source
computational tools and models to support the design, analysis, optimization,
scale-up, operation and troubleshooting of innovative, advanced energy systems.

## Getting Started

Our [complete documentation is online](https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) but here is a summarized set of steps to get started using the framework.

While not required, we encourage the installation of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and using the `conda` command to create a separate python environment in which to install the IDAES Toolkit.

Use conda to create a new "idaes-pse" (could be any name you like) environment then activate that environment:
```bash
conda create --name idaes-pse python=3.10
conda activate idaes-pse
```

Now, in that "idaes-pse" environment, install the IDAES Toolkit using either `pip install` or `conda install` (but not both):

```bash
# install latest stable release
pip install idaes-pse
# install latest stable release with one set of optional dependencies, e.g. `ui` for the user interface
pip install "idaes-pse[ui]"
# install latest stable release with multiple sets of optional dependencies
pip install "idaes-pse[ui,dmf,omlt,grid,coolprop]"
# install latest version from the main branch of this repository
pip install "idaes-pse @ git+https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-pse@main"
# install from the `mybranch` branch of the fork belonging to `myuser`
pip install "idaes-pse @ git+https://github.com/myuser/idaes-pse@mybranch"
```

You can check the version installed with the command:

```bash
idaes --version
```

Now install the examples and the pre-build extensions (binary solvers):

```bash
idaes get-examples
idaes get-extensions
```

This will install the examples into an `examples` subdirectory which can be opened using a [Jypter](https://jupyter.org) Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook examples/notebook_index.ipynb
```
From there you can explore the examples and tutorials.

For more information on how to use Jupyter Lab, use the built-in *Help* menu and the extensive documentation on the [Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org).

Finally, refer to the [complete idaes-pse documentation](https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/stable) for detailed [installation instructions](https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/getting_started/index.html), examples, guides, and reference.

## System requirements

The code and examples have been tested with the following operating systems:

|Operating system|Supported versions  |
|----------------|--------------------|
| Linux          | Any modern Linux   |
| Windows        | Windows 10         |
| macOS          | Partly supported*  |

*HSL is not currently provided for macOS on Intel processors, so some features may be limited or not available.

Most of the functionality is implemented in Python. In accordance with
the end-of-life for many Python 2 libraries, the IDAES Toolkit is written
for Python 3. The following sub-versions are supported:

* Python 3.8
* Python 3.9
* Python 3.10
* Python 3.11

Note that Python 3.6 is *not* supported.

## Contacts and more information

General, background and overview information is available at the [IDAES main website](https://www.idaes.org).
Framework development happens at our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-pse) where you can ask questions by starting a [discussion](https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-pse/discussions), [report issues/bugs](https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-pse/issues) or [make contributions](https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-pse/pulls).
