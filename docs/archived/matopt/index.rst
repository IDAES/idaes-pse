MatOpt: Nanomaterials Optimization
==================================

.. warning::

    MatOpt was removed from the IDAES codebase in v2.1 (24th February 2023) due to lack of support an maintenance. Git hash: 717deec3681b87752e9fa32819f251f634d0f9e8

The MatOpt module provides tools for nanomaterials design using Mathematical Optimization. MatOpt can be used to design crystalline nanostructured materials, including but not limited to particles, wires, surfaces, and periodic bulk structures.

The main goals of this package are as follows:

* To automate many of the steps that are necessary for utilizing mathematical optimization to design materials, speeding up the development of new mathematical models and accelerating new materials discovery.
* To simplify the representation of nanostructured materials and their structure-function relationships as Pyomo objects, streamlining the creation of materials optimization problems in the Pyomo modeling language.
* To provide a simple interface so that users need not handle the details of casting efficient mathematical optimization models, invoking mathematical optimization solvers, or utilizing specialized Pyomo syntax to do this.
