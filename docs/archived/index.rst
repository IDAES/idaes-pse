Archived Features
=================

This section of the docs maintains a list of archived features from previous versions of IDAES which are no longer supported. Each feature will indicate the last version of IDAES in which it was supported for users who wish to attempt to use these tools.

The IDAES team is open to having theses tools revived if there is sufficient interest, but do not have the resource to update and maintain the code themselves. If a feature listed here is of sufficient interest to you and you are willing to update and help maintain the code, the IDAES team will welcome pull request to reintroduce these features.

.. note::

    As the IDAES and its underlying dependencies continue to evolve, it may be difficult to find a version of all dependencies that will allow the code to run. Users should be aware of this, and understand that the IDAES team makes no guarantees about the operability of the code and will be unable to help with any issues that arise.
