RIPE: Reaction Identification and Parameter Estimation
=======================================================

.. warning::

    RIPE was removed from the IDAES codebase in v2.1 (24th February 2023) due to lack of support an maintenance. Git hash: 717deec3681b87752e9fa32819f251f634d0f9e8

The RIPE module provides tools for reaction network identification. RIPE uses reactor data consisting of concentration, or conversion, values for multiple species that are obtained dynamically, or at multiple process conditions (temperatures, flow rates, working volumes) to identify probable reaction kinetics. The RIPE module also contains tools to facilitate adaptive experimental design. The experimental design tools in RIPE require the use of the python package RBFopt. More information for RBFopt is availible at www.github.com/coin-or/rbfopt
