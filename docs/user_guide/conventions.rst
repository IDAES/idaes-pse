Units of Measurement and Reference States
-----------------------------------------

Due to the flexibility provided by the IDAES Integrated Platform, there is no standard set of units of measurement or standard reference state that should be used in models. Units of measurement are defined by the modeler for the 7 base quantities (time, length, mass, amount, temperature, current and luminous intensity) in each property package, and the platform makes use of this and Pyomo's Units container to automatically determine the units of all variables and expressions within a model. Thus, all components within a model using a given property package must use units based on the units chosen for the base quantities (to ensure consistency of units). However, flowsheets may contain property packages which use different sets of base units, however users should be careful to ensure units are converted correctly where property packages interact. For more detail on defining units of measurement see :ref:`Defining Units of Measurement<user_guide/components/property_package/uom:Defining Units of Measurement>`.

Pyomo also provides convenient tools for converting between different units of measurement and checking for unit consistency, of which a few are highlighted below:

* ``units.convert(var, to_units=units)`` - returns a Pyomo expression including the variable `var` and the necessary conversion factors to convert it to the desired set of units (`units`). This method will return an `Exception` if the units of `var` are not consistent with those requested by the user.
* ``units.assert_units_consistent(object)`` - checks for consistency of units in `object` and raises an `AssertionError` if they are not. `object` may be a `Block`, `Constraint` or `Expression`.

The IDAES developers have generally used SI units without prefixes (i.e. Pa, not kPa) within models developed by the institute, with a default thermodynamic reference state of 298.15 K and 101325 Pa. Supercritical fluids have been consider to be part of the liquid phase, as they will be handled via pumps rather than compressors.

Standard Variable Names
-----------------------
In order for different models to communicate information effectively, it is necessary to have 
a standard naming convention for any variable that may need to be shared between different 
models. Within IDAES, this occurs most frequently when information 
regarding the state and properties of the material, which is calculated 
in specialized PropertyBlocks, is used in others parts of the model.

Standard Naming Format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There are a wide range of different variables which may be of interest to modelers, and a 
number of different ways in which these quantities can be expressed. In order to facilitate 
communication between different parts of models, a naming convention has been established to 
standardize the naming of variables across models. Variable names within IDAES follow to the 
format below::

    {property_name}_{basis}_{state}_{condition}

Here, property_name is the name of the quantity in question, and should be drawn from the list 
of standard variable names given later in this document. If a particular quantity is not 
included in the list of standard names, users are encouraged to contact the IDAES developers 
so that it can be included in a future release. This is followed by a number of qualifiers 
which further indicate the specific conditions under which the quantity is being calculated. 
These qualifiers are described below, and some examples are given at the end of this document.

Basis Qualifier
"""""""""""""""
Many properties of interest to modelers are most conveniently represented on an intensive basis, 
that is quantity per unit amount of material. There are a number of different bases that can be 
used when expressing intensive quantities, and a list of standard basis qualifiers are given 
below.

============ =============
Basis        Standard Name
============ =============
Mass Basis   mass
Molar Basis  mol
Volume Basis vol
============ =============

State Qualifier
"""""""""""""""
Many quantities can be calculated either for the whole or a part of a mixture. In these cases, a qualifier is added to the quantity to indicate which part of the mixture the quantity applies to. In these cases, quantities may also be indexed by a Pyomo Set.

================= ============= ===================================
Basis             Standard Name Comments
================= ============= ===================================
Component         comp          Indexed by component list
Phase             phase         Indexed by phase list
Phase & Component phase_comp    Indexed by phase and component list
Total Mixture                   No state qualifier
================= ============= ===================================

=================== =============
Phase               Standard Name

Ionic Species       ion
Liquid Phase        liq
Solid Phase         sol
Vapor Phase         vap
Multiple Phases     e.g. liq1
=================== =============

Condition Qualifier
"""""""""""""""""""
There are also cases where a modeler may want to calculate a quantity at some state other than the actual state of the system (e.g. at the critical point, or at equilibrium).

================== =============
Basis              Standard Name
================== =============
Critical Point     crit
Equilibrium State  equil
Ideal Gas          ideal
Reduced Properties red
Reference State    ref
================== =============

Constants
^^^^^^^^^
IDAES contains a library of common physical constants of use in process systems engineering 
models, which can be imported from `idaes.core.util.constants`. Below is a list of these 
constants with their standard names and values (SI units).

.. note::

    It is important to note that these constants are represented as Pyomo `expressions` in order to include units of measurement. As such, they can be directly included in other `expressions` within a model. However, if the user desires to use their value directly (e.g. to initialize a variable), the `value()` method must be used to extract the value of the constant from the `expression`.

[1] pi imported from the Python `math` library and is available to machine precision.

Values for fundamental constants and derived constants are drawn from the definitions of SI 
units (https://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si-brochure/SI-Brochure-9.pdf) and are generally 
defined to 9 significant figures.

Acceleration due to gravity, gravitational constant and electron mass are sourced from NIST 
(https://physics.nist.gov) and used the significant figures reported there.
