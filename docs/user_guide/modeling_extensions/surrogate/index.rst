ALAMOpy, RIPE, and HELMET are
data driven machine learning (ddm-learning) tools.
They are regression tools for the development of property models for kinetics and
thermodynamics of a system. The provided tools include both ALAMOpy and RIPE that can
access ALAMO and other solvers through the Python API.

Python-based Surrogate Modeling Objects (PySMO) is a framework for general-purpose
surrogate modeling techniques, integrated with the Pyomo mathematical optimization
framework (on which IDAES is also based).
