Command-line interface
======================
The IDAES PSE Toolkit includes a command-line tool that can be invoked
by typing `idaes` in a UNIX or Mac OSX shell, or Windows Powershell,
that is in an installed IDAES environment. Generally, the `idaes` command
is available where you install IDAES.

This section of the documentation describes the capabilities of this
command-line program.

idaes command
-------------
The base `idaes` command does not do anything by itself, besides set some
shared configuration values. All the real work is done by one of the subcommands,
each of which is described on a separate page below.
