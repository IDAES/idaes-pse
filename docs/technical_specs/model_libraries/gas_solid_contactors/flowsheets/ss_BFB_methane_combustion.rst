Methane Combustion in a Bubbling Fluidized Bed (steady-state)
=============================================================

.. currentmodule:: idaes.gas_solid_contactors.flowsheets.ss_BFB_methane_combustion

Steady-state flowsheet example of the bubbling fluidized bed model for methane combustion with an iron-oxide based oxygen carrier.

This model is for demonstration and tutorial purposes only.

Inputs:

* Bed diameter
* Bed height
* Number of orifices
* Gas feed  - flowrate, pressure, temperature, composition
* Solid feed - flowrate, particle porosity, temperature, composition
