Liquid Phase Property Methods
=============================

The  liquid phase property methods (and parameters) for post-combustion carbon
capture using Monoethalnolamine (MEA) solvent includes :

*  Liquid density and molar volume.
*  Specific heat capacity of liquid (MEA, H2O).
*  Specific heat capacity of CO2-loaded solution.
*  Heat of CO2 absorption.
*  Henryâ€™s constant.
*  Concentration based equilibrium constants.
*  Viscosity of the liquid solution.
*  Liquid thermal conductivity.
*  Binary diffusivity of vapor components.
*  Diffusivity of CO2 in aqueous MEA.
*  Diffusivity of MEA in solution.
*  Diffusivity of MEAH+ and MEACOO-.
*  Liquid surface tension.
*  Second order rate constant.
