Institute for the Design of Advanced Energy Systems (IDAES)
===========================================================

Project Goals
-------------
The Institute for the Design of Advanced Energy Systems (IDAES) will be the
world’s premier resource for the development and analysis of innovative
advanced energy systems through the use of process systems engineering tools
and approaches. IDAES and its capabilities will be applicable to the development
of the full range of advanced fossil energy systems, including chemical looping
and other transformational |CO2| capture technologies, as well as integration with
other new technologies such as supercritical |CO2|.

For a more detailed overview of the :term:`IDAES integrated platform <IDAES-IP>`, see :doc:`this page <user_guide/concepts>`.

Collaborating institutions
--------------------------
The IDAES team is comprised of collaborators from the following institutions:

* National Energy Technology Laboratory (Lead)
* Sandia National Laboratory
* Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
* Carnegie-Mellon University (subcontract to LBNL)
* West Virginia University (subcontract to LBNL)
* University of Notre Dame (subcontract to LBNL)

Contact us
-----------
General, background and overview information is available at the `IDAES main
website <https://www.idaes.org>`_.  Framework development happens at our `GitHub
repo <https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-pse>`_ where you can `report issues/bugs
<https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-pse/issues>`_ or `make contributions
<https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-pse/pulls>`_.  For further enquiries, send an
