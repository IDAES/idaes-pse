Nonlinear Model Predictive Control
==================================

Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is control strategy in which control 
inputs are determined by the solution of an optimization problem every time
the plant is sampled.

Optimization Problem
--------------------

An explanation of the optimization problem solved in this implementation
of NMPC is forthcoming.
