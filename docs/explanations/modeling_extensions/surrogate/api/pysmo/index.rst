PySMO: Python-based Surrogate Modeling Objects
==============================================

THIS DOCUMENT WILL HAVE MORE CONTENT

The PySMO toolbox provides tools for generating different types of reduced order models. It provides
IDAES users with a set of surrogate modeling tools which supports flowsheeting and direct integration
into an equation-oriented modeling framework. It allows users to directly integrate reduced order
models with algebraic high-fidelity process models within an single IDAES flowsheet.

PySMO provides two sets of tools necessary for sampling and surrogate model generation.

Surrogate Generation
--------------------

PySMO offers tools for generating three types of surrogates:
