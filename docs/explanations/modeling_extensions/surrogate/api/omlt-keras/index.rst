OMLT: Optimization and Machine Learning Toolkit
===============================================

Keras is a deep learning framework that integrates with TensorFlow's structure for
building and training artificial neural networks, and minimizes the number of user
actions required to construct accurate networks. OMLT (Optimization and Machine
Learning Toolkit) provides an interface to formulate machine learning models and
import Keras or ONNX models as Pyomo blocks. The provided tools include an interface
for accessing the Keras module (via the publicly available Python package) within
IDAES flowsheets.
