Sampling
========
The PySMO package offers five common sampling methods for one-shot design:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   pysmo_lhs
   pysmo_uniform
   pysmo_halton
   pysmo_hammersley
   pysmo_cvt
   pysmo_sampling_properties


Further information about the sampling tools and their input options may be found by accessing the individual
sampling methods. Examples and details of the characteristics of the sampling methods may be found at
