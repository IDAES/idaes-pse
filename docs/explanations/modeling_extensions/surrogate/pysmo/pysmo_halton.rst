Halton Sampling
==================
Halton sampling is a low-discrepancy sampling method. It is a deterministic sampling method based on the Halton sequence, a sequence constructed by a set of co-prime bases. The Halton
sequence is an n-dimensional extension of the Van der Corput sequence; each individual Halton sequence is based on a radix inverse function defined on a prime number.

The ``pysmo.sampling.HaltonSampling`` method carries out Halton sampling. This can be done in two modes:

* The samples can be selected from a user-provided dataset, or
* The samples can be generated from a set of provided bounds.

The Halton sampling method is only available for low-dimensional problems :math:`n \leq 10`. At higher dimensions, the performance of the sampling method has been shown to degrade.
