Full-Factorial Sampling
===============================

The ``pysmo.sampling.UniformSampling`` method carries out Uniform (full-factorial) sampling. This can be done in two modes:

* The samples can be selected from a user-provided dataset, or
* The samples can be generated from a set of provided bounds.

Available Methods
