Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS)
===========================================
LHS is a stratified random sampling method originally developed for efficient uncertainty assessment. LHS partitions the parameter space 
into bins of equal probability with the goal of attaining a more even distribution of sample points in the parameter space that would be possible with pure random sampling.

 
The ``pysmo.sampling.LatinHypercubeSampling`` method carries out Latin Hypercube sampling. This can be done in two modes:

* The samples can be selected from a user-provided dataset, or
* The samples can be generated from a set of provided bounds.
