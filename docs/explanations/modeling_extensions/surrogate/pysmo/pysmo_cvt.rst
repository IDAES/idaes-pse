Centroidal voronoi tessellation (CVT) sampling
===================================================
In CVT, the generating point of each Voronoi cell coincides with its center of mass; CVT sampling locates the design samples at the centroids of each Voronoi cell in
the input space. CVT sampling is a geometric, space-filling sampling method which is similar to k-means clustering in its simplest form.

The ``pysmo.sampling.CVTSampling`` method carries out CVT sampling. This can be done in two modes:

* The samples can be selected from a user-provided dataset, or
* The samples can be generated from a set of provided bounds.

The CVT sampling algorithm implemented here is based on McQueen's method which involves a series of random sampling and averaging steps,
