Tutorials and Examples
======================

The |examples-site| has a **diverse set of examples and tutorials**,
in the form of pre-executed Jupyter notebooks that show all the steps, inputs,
and outputs.

To **run the examples** on your own computer, follow the instructions on the `idaes-examples page on PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/idaes-examples/>`_.

You can also see and **download the example code** from the `public repository on GitHub <https://github.com/IDAES/examples>`_.

For **help performing specific tasks**, such as creating custom unit models and property models, see  the :doc:`how-to guides <../how_to_guides/index>`.
