Binary Packages
===============

This section describes what is in the IDAES binary distribution, where it is
installed, how to use it, and alternative installation methods.  The IDAES binary
distribution contains mainly third-party solvers compiled for user convenience and
function libraries used for some IDAES physical property packages.

Installation is generally done through the
:doc:`idaes get-extensions command<../../reference_guides/commands/get_extensions>`.

What is Included
----------------

The National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) has obtained a distribution
license for HSL linear solvers that allows inclusion in IDAES's compiled version
of Ipopt.

All technical papers, sales and publicity material resulting from use of
the HSL codes within IPOPT must contain the following acknowledgement: HSL, a
collection of Fortran codes for large-scale scientific computation. See
http://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk.

Install Location
----------------

The location of the binary file installation is not currently configurable and
it can be found with the command line command ``idaes bin-directory``.

Manual Installation
-------------------

The install location is not configurable, but the installation step can easily be
done manually. This is occasionally necessary when, for example, a firewall
blocks downloading the binary file from GitHub.

The first step for a manual install is to determine the location of the IDAES
binary directory, which can be done with the command ``idaes bin-directory``.

Download the IDAES binary release files from
`the binary releases page <https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-ext/releases>`_.
You will need ``idaes-lib-{platform}.tar.gz``, ``idaes-solvers-{platform}.tar.gz``,
and ``idaes-{optional package}-{platform}.tar.gz``. Extract the tar files in the
IDAES binary directory.

Using Solvers Without IDAES
---------------------------

Generally, the environment variables are set up to use the IDAES solvers when any
idaes module is imported in Python.  If you would like to use the solvers in
Pyomo without importing IDAES, you will need to add the install location to your
executable and dynamic library search path environment variables as appropriate
for your operating system (e.g. add the install location to $PATH in Linux).

If you would like to use the IDAES binary distribution with Pyomo and have IDAES
installed the simplest way to set the appropriate paths is just to
``import idaes``.

Using the WSL
-------------

The Linux binary builds can be run on Windows using the
`WSL <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about>`_.  This is useful
when solvers depend on POSIX standards.  Currently the optional PETSc solver is
the only one which does not run on Windows.

In the WSL environment, download and extract the desired Linux release (e.g. Ubuntu 20.04) of
the solver (i.e. PETSc) you would like to run following the instructions under manual
installation above. Then install required libraries for your release (see
installation instructions `here <https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/index.html#linux>`_
for supported distributions).

In the WSL environment you can check that PETSc is installed correctly. In your
desired Linux release navigate to the folder containing the compiled PETSc binary
and run the command ``./petsc --version``. If setup correctly, details of the PETSc
release will be printed on the screen.

In the Windows IDAES binary directory, create a
batch file with the format ``{solver}_wsl.bat`` for example for PETSc
``petsc_wsl.bat``. The location of the IDAES binary directory can be found by running
the command ``idaes bin-directory``. Assuming you have put the binary file in ``$HOME/local/bin``
and your WSL user name is ``john``, and the distribution installed is ``Ubuntu-20.04``
the contents of the batch file to run the PETSc solver are below:

.. code-block ::

  @echo off
  idaes solver-wsl --distribution Ubuntu-20.04 --user john --executable ~/local/bin/petsc %*

If you are unsure of the name of your installed distribution, navigate to your linux
release and run the command ``wsl --list --all``. This will list all your linux
distributions (if you have more than one) with their names.

There are several options to check that your ``{solver}_wsl.bat``
(e.g. ``petsc_wsl.bat``) file is installed correctly.
In an Anaconda Prompt window or a Command Prompt window run the command
``%LOCALAPPDATA%\idaes\bin\petsc_wsl.bat --version``. For users of Git Bash,
open a Git Bash window and run the command
``$LOCALAPPDATA/idaes/bin/petsc_wsl.bat --version``.
While for powershell, open a powershell window and run the command
``start-process -NoNewWindow -wait $Env:LOCALAPPDATA\idaes\bin\petsc_wsl.bat â€“version``.
In all cases, the conda environment where the solver is installed has to be active (i.e. activate it with ``conda activate <env name>``).
Details of the solver release version will be printed on the screen if the setup has been completed correctly.

If you want to use user-defined AMPL functions with a WSL solver while running IDAES
in the normal Windows environment, you will need to set the ``AMPLFUNC`` environment
variable in the WSL environment manually. The ``AMPLFUNC`` variable is a newline-separated
list of paths to shared libraries containing user-defined AMPL functions.  The easiest way
to handle user-defined functions in this case is to just set ``AMPLFUNC`` in your
``.bashrc`` file then run the WSL command in interactive mode, with the batch file
setup below.

.. code-block ::

  @echo off
  idaes solver-wsl --distribution Ubuntu-20.04 --user john --executable bash -ic '~/local/bin/petsc %*'
