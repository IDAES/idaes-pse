.. note::
    If you want to install multiple versions of IDAES in different environments, you can set the ``IDAES_DATA`` environment variable before installing
    IDAES or using IDAES.  The easiest way to do this is to set the environment variable as part of activating your environment before 
    installing IDAES.  Setting this environment variable will keep binary extensions and configuration files separate for the different IDAES versions.
    For more information about setting environment variables as part of a conda or virtual environment, see the conda or venv documentation.
