Run the :doc:`idaes get-examples command <../../../reference_guides/commands/get_examples>` to download and install the example files :: 

    idaes get-examples

By default this will install in a folder "examples" in the current directory.
The command has many options, but an important
one is ``--dir``, which specifies the folder in which to install. :: 

   idaes get-examples --dir <PATH>

An example of the path formatting would look like |os_specific_fpath|
