The URL for an IDAES repository, e.g. “some-repo”, will be
``https://github.com/IDAES/some-repo``.

Public vs. Private
------------------
All these repositories except for “idaes-pse” will only be visible on
Github, on the web, for people who have been added to the IDAES
developer team in the IDAES “organization” (See `About Github
organizations <https://help.github.com/articles/about-organizations/>`_).
If you are a member of the IDAES team and not in the IDAES Github organization,
please contact one of the core developers.
The `idaes-pse` repository will be visible to anyone, even
people without a Github account.
