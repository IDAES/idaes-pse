SVD Toolbox
===========

The IDAES SVD Toolbox is an advanced diagnostics tool for helping to identify scaling and degeneracy issues in models using Singular Value Decomposition and is accessible through the ``DiagnosticsToolbox``. Further discussion of how to use and interpret SVD results can be found :ref:`here<explanations/model_diagnostics/svd_analysis:SVD Analysis>`.
