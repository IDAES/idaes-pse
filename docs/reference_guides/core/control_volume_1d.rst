1D Control Volume Class
=======================

.. contents:: Contents
    :depth: 2

The ControlVolume1DBlock block is used for systems with one spatial dimension where material flows parallel to the spatial domain. Examples of these types of unit operations include plug flow reactors and pipes. ControlVolume1DBlock blocks are discretized along the length domain and contain one StateBlock and one ReactionBlock (if applicable) at each point in the domain (including the inlet and outlet).

ControlVolume1DBlock Equations
-------------------------------

This section documents the variables and constraints created by each of the methods provided by the ControlVolume0DBlock class.

* :math:`t` indicates time index
* :math:`x` indicates spatial (length) index
* :math:`p` indicates phase index
* :math:`j` indicates component index
* :math:`e` indicates element index
* :math:`r` indicates reaction name index

Most terms within the balance equations written by ControlVolume1DBlock are on a basis of per unit length (e.g. :math:`mol/m \cdot s`).

add_geometry
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The add_geometry method creates the normalized length domain for the control volume (or a reference to an external domain). All constraints in ControlVolume1DBlock assume a normalized length domain, with values between 0 and 1.

This method also adds variables and constraints to describe the geometry of the control volume. ControlVolume1DBlock does not support varying dimensions of the control volume with time at this stage.

**Constraints**

`geometry_constraint`:

.. math:: V = A \times L

add_phase_component_balances
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Material balances are written for each component in each phase (e.g. separate balances for liquid water and steam). Physical property packages may include information to indicate that certain species do not appear in all phases, and material balances will not be written in these cases (if `has_holdup` is True holdup terms will still appear for these species, however these will be set to 0).

**Constraints**

`material_balances(t, x, p, j)`:

.. math:: L \times \frac{\partial M_{t, x, p, j}}{\partial t} = fd \times \frac{\partial F_{t, x, p, j}}{\partial x} + L \times N_{kinetic, t, x, p, j} + L \times N_{equilibrium, t, x, p, j} + L \times N_{pe, t, x, p, j} + L \times N_{transfer, t, x, p, j} + L \times N_{custom, t, x, p, j}

:math:`fd` is a flow direction term, which allows for material flow to be defined in either direction. If material flow is defined as `forward`, :math:`fd = -1`, otherwise :math:`fd = 1`.

The :math:`N_{custom, t, x, p, j}` term allows the user to provide custom terms (variables or expressions) in both mass and molar basis which will be added into the material balances, which will be converted as necessary to the same basis as the material balance (by multiplying or dividing by the component molecular weight). The basis of the material balance is determined by the physical property package, and if undefined (or not mass or mole basis), an Exception will be returned.

`material_flow_linking_constraints(t, x, p, j)`:

This constraint is an internal constraint used to link the extensive material flow terms in the StateBlocks into a single indexed variable. This is required as Pyomo.DAE requires a single indexed variable to create the associated DerivativeVars and their numerical expansions.

If `has_holdup` is True, `material_holdup_calculation(t, x, p, j)`:

.. math:: M_{t, x, p, j} = \rho_{t, x, p, j} \times A \times \phi_{t, x, p}

where :math:`\rho_{t, x, p ,j}` is the density of component :math:`j` in phase :math:`p` at time :math:`t` and location :math:`x`.

If `dynamic` is True:

Numerical discretization of the derivative terms, :math:`\frac{\partial M_{t,x,p,j}}{\partial t}`, will be performed by Pyomo.DAE.

If `has_rate_reactions` is True, `rate_reaction_stoichiometry_constraint(t, x, p, j)`:

.. math:: N_{kinetic, t, x, p, j} = \alpha_{r, p, j} \times X_{kinetic, t, x, r}

where :math:`\alpha_{r, p. j}` is the stoichiometric coefficient of component :math:`j` in phase :math:`p` for reaction :math:`r` (as defined in the PhysicalParameterBlock).

If `has_equilibrium_reactions` argument is True, `equilibrium_reaction_stoichiometry_constraint(t, x, p, j)`:

where :math:`\alpha_{r, p. j}` is the stoichiometric coefficient of component :math:`j` in phase :math:`p` for reaction :math:`r` (as defined in the PhysicalParameterBlock).

add_total_component_balances
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
