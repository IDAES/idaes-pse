Solid-Liquid Unit Models
========================

This library contains models specific for solid-liquid processing operations (although some of them may also be applicable in other circumstances). Models in this library assume streams consist of separate solid and liquid phases (with separate property packages) and thus all streams are represented by separate solid and liquid ports. Separation of solids and liquids is generally assumed to result in a concentrated solid-liquid stream and a clarified liquid stream.
