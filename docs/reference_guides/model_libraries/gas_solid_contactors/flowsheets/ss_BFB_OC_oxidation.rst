Oxygen Carrier Oxidation in a Bubbling Fluidized Bed (steady-state)
===================================================================

.. currentmodule:: idaes.gas_solid_contactors.flowsheets.ss_BFB_OC_oxidation

Steady-state flowsheet example of the bubbling fluidized bed model for oxidation of an iron-oxide based oxygen carrier with oxygen (air).

This model is for demonstration and tutorial purposes only.

Inputs:

* Bed diameter
* Bed height
* Number of orifices
* Gas feed  - flowrate, pressure, temperature, composition
* Solid feed - flowrate, particle porosity, temperature, composition
