Multi-Period Modeling
=====================

Multi-period modeling can be used to simplify dynamic optimization problems
by linking steady-state models over a time horizon with rate-limiting constraints.
Therefore, sets of constraints at one temporal index will affect decisions taken
at a different moment in time. These interactions can be used to model the relationship
between the energy systems and wholesale electricity markets.
