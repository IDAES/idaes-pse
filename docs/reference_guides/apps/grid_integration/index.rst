Grid integration (Double loop)
============================================
The subpackage implements a new generalized multiscale simulation framework (shown in
figure) that integrates the process and grid modeling paradigms to quantify
the operational (hours to year timescale) interactions between energy systems and
wholesale electricity markets. For more information, please look at the introduction section.
